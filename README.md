# Monorock

## Deploy

The API is deployed to Google Cloud run as a stateless service.
The Frontend is deployed to Firestore.

### Deploy API to GCP

- Create an GCP project with billing enabled(PROJECT_ID)
- [`gcloud config set project {PROJECT_ID}]`]

#### Build

- [`ng build api`]
- Run pre-build steps, (only needed after clean build) [`npm run-script prebuild:apijson`], [`npm run-script prebuild:apidocker`], [`npm run-script prebuild:apipackage`]
- [`cd /dist/apps/api`]
- [`gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/{PROJECT_ID}/monorock-api`]

#### Manual Deploy

Deploy the API to Cloud Run with:

- [`gcloud beta run deploy {servicename} --image gcr.io/{PROJECT_ID}/monorock-api --allow-unauthenticated --update-env-vars NODE_ENV=production`]
- Test the API by navigating to the url generated by the service: {serviceurl}/api/hello

### Deploy Frontend to Firestore:

- Initialize project in Firestore console. (Project is shared with GCP)
- [`firestore init`] Initialise firetore for hosting only. set public folder to dist/apps/rockme

#### Build

- [`ng build rockme`]

#### Manual Deploy

- [`firebase deploy --only hosting`]
- In order to connect the frontend to the API, ensure that the rewrite rule is in firebase.json

### Test Manual Deploy

Go to the url returned from the firebase command (or specified in the firebase console).
You should now see the basic Nrwl app and welcome message from the API

## Adding capabilities to your workspace

Nx supports many plugins which add capabilities for developing different types of applications and different tools.

These capabilities include generating applications, libraries, etc as well as the devtools to test, and build projects as well.

Below are some plugins which you can add to your workspace:

- [Angular](https://angular.io)
  - `ng add @nrwl/angular`
- [React](https://reactjs.org)
  - `ng add @nrwl/react`
- Web (no framework frontends)
  - `ng add @nrwl/web`
- [Nest](https://nestjs.com)
  - `ng add @nrwl/nest`
- [Express](https://expressjs.com)
  - `ng add @nrwl/express`
- [Node](https://nodejs.org)
  - `ng add @nrwl/node`

## Generate an application

Run `ng g @nrwl/angular:app my-app` to generate an application.

> You can use any of the plugins above to generate applications as well.

When using Nx, you can create multiple applications and libraries in the same workspace.

## Generate a library

Run `ng g @nrwl/angular:lib my-lib` to generate a library.

> You can also use any of the plugins above to generate libraries as well.

Libraries are sharable across libraries and applications. They can be imported from `@monorock/mylib`.

## Development server

Run `ng serve my-app` for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng g component my-component --project=my-app` to generate a new component.

## Build

Run `ng build my-app` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test my-app` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io).

Run `nx affected:test` to execute the unit tests affected by a change.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e my-app` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io).

Run `nx affected:e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests affected by a change.

## Understand your workspace

Run `nx dep-graph` to see a diagram of the dependencies of your projects.
